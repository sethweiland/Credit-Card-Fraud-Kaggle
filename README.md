# Credit-Card-Fraud-Kaggle

#### Experimented with a couple different classic anomaly detection and ML techniques in order to detect credit card fraud. Best results were LGBM with ROC_AUC of ~=.975 on holdout set, and a 2-layer neural network that performed with ROC_AUC of ~=.965. GridSearch CV significantly improved the LGBM performance from a baseline LGBM model.
